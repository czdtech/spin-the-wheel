            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Last Updated: [ 06-20, 2025 ]</strong></p>

            <p>Welcome to spin the Wheel (the "Service," "we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our web-based lucky wheel and name picker tool.</p>

            <h3>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
            <p>Our Service is designed to be used directly in your web browser without requiring you to create an account or provide any personally identifiable information (PII) to us.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No User Accounts:</strong> We do not offer user registration or login functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>No Server-Side Data Storage by Us:</strong> All data you input into the wheel (such as names or items for the wheel segments) and your customized settings (like themes, sounds, spin duration, custom colors) are stored <strong>locally in your web browser's local storage</strong> on your own device. This information is not transmitted to, stored on, or accessed by our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>No Tracking of Personal Data:</strong> We do not use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect personal data about your usage beyond standard, anonymous web analytics that may be collected by our hosting provider for general traffic analysis (e.g., number of visitors, page views), which does not identify individual users.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Information You Provide and How It's Used Locally</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wheel Entries:</strong> Any text you enter into the "Entries" text area to populate the wheel segments is processed and stored solely within your browser's local storage. This allows the wheel to function and for your list to be available when you revisit the Service from the same browser.</li>
                <li><strong>Customization Settings:</strong> Your preferences for color themes, sound settings, spin duration, font choices, and custom segment colors are also stored in your browser's local storage to personalize your experience and persist your settings between sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Import/Export Functionality:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you use the "Import" feature, you select a <code>.txt</code> file from your own device. The content of this file is read by your browser and used to populate the wheel entries locally. The file itself is not uploaded to our servers.</li>
                        <li>When you use the "Export" feature, a <code>.txt</code> file containing your current wheel entries is generated by your browser and downloaded directly to your device. This data does not pass through our servers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Data Security (Local Storage)</h3>
            <p>While we do not collect or store your data on our servers, the security of the data stored in your browser's local storage is dependent on the security of your own device and browser. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device. Clearing your browser's cache or local storage will erase any data saved by our Service.</p>

            <h3>4. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Fonts:</strong> We use Google Fonts to enhance the visual appearance of the Service. Google Fonts may collect aggregated, non-identifiable usage data. Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</li>
                <li><strong>Hosting Provider:</strong> Our website is hosted by a third-party provider. This provider may collect standard server logs (e.g., IP address, browser type, access times) for security and operational purposes. This data is generally not used to personally identify you.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>Our Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold depending on your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

            <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

            <h3>7. Contact Us</h3>
