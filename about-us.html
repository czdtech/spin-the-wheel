            <h3>Why This Wheel?</h3>
            <p>In a world फुल of choices, sometimes the most liberating thing is a simple spin. We created this tool because we saw a need for a straightforward, reliable, and ad-free (or minimal ad) random picker that users could depend on. Whether you're a teacher looking for a fair way to call on students, a marketer running a giveaway, or just trying to decide what to have for dinner, our wheel is here to help.</p>
            <p>Key features we focused on include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> Get started in seconds – just type your entries and spin.</li>
                <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Tailor the wheel with custom entries, weights, colors, fonts, and sounds to fit your exact needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> Our algorithm ensures that selections are random, and weighted entries are proportionally represented.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy-Focused:</strong> All your data (entries, settings) is stored locally in your browser. We don't collect it.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Designed to be functional and clear across different devices.</li>
            </ul>
